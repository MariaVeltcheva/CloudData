The application which implements these sequential and parallel methods is called CloudData. 
The CloudData class accepts three command line parameters. The first is the path to the input file, 
the second is the path to the output file where the results will be written to and the third 
is to indicate if the program is to run the parallel methods or the serial methods. 
If the parallel methods are to be run then the third command line parameter must be “parallel”,
if the serial methods are to be run then only the first two command line parameters are entered.
